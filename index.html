        <p1> Hello my name is Katia Martinez and I currently reside in San Bernardino California.
            I am just starting my journey in becoming a developer and I am already hungry to learn more.
            Before embarking on this journey I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do as a career but now that 
            I have dabbled in this field I know that I want this to be my future. Before coding was introduced to
            me I worked moslty as a quality technition, inspecting product produced by manufacturing companies. Such as 
            Aerospace, Orthodontics, Pool, and  wire harnessing parts.
            On my spare time I enjoy being active and excercising my body , I practice Muay Thai and indoor bouldering 
            but I also love being anywhere that is outdoors.
