        <p1> Hello my name is Katia Martinez and I currently reside in San Bernardino California.
            I am just starting my journey in becoming a developer and I am already hungry to learn more.
            Before coding was introduced to me I worked moslty as a quality technition, inspecting product produced by large manufacturing companies. 
            Such as Aerospace, Orthodontics, Pool parts, and  wire harnessing parts.
            On my spare time I enjoy being active and excercising my body , I practice Muay Thai and indoor bouldering but I also love being anywhere that is outdoors.
        </p1>
